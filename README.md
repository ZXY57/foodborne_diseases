# PHP 2550 Final Project
## Statistical Machine Learning for Modeling Foodborne Disease Source Attribution
This project was conducted as the final project for the PHP 2550 Practical Data Analysis, Fall 2022, School of Public Health, Brown University. We are working on a project regarding using Bayesian and ensemble-based machine learning methods and core genome multilocus sequencing typing data and other selected information about the sampled Listeria monocytogenes isolates in the US. We hope our project can help enhance food safety, reduce the burden of foodborne illnesses and improve public health. This repository holds files related to the project in practical data analysis: Statistical Machine Learning Methods for Modeling Foodborne Disease Outbreaks.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Organization 

- `data`: This folder contains the `listeria_isolates.csv` data files used in order to conduct the analyses for our study. This is the cleaned data from the raw data files downloaded directly from the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/). This folder also contains the `analysis_script.R`, which is the code of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- `figures`: This folder contains flow chart of data cleaning in this project. 

- `main_files/figure-latex`: This file contains all figures we get from the full Exploratory Data Analysis report done for the project.

- `main.Rmd` and `main.pdf`: This file contains the written Literature Review and full Exploratory Data Analysis report done for this project. The pdf version hides the code. 

- `references.bib`: This file contains all the reference literatures we list in this project.


More folders and files to be added throughout the course of the project.
