## Statistical Machine Learning for *Listeria monocytogene* Food Source Attribution

This repository holds files related to the final project in PHP2550 Practical Data Analysis: *Statistical Machine Learning for Foodborne Disease Source Attribution* using *L. monocytogene* pathogen data downloaded from the [NCBI Pathogen Detection Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/) conducted in Fall 2022, School of Public Health, Brown University. This project sought to use ensemble-based machine learning methods and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) data and other selected information about the sampled *Listeria monocytogenes* isolates in the United States (US). We seek to examine these data more closely and employ statistical methods to extract patterns, as well as, substantial predictors of a food source associated with a given *L. monocytogene* isolate and consider exploring the particular advantage presented by cgMLST and machine learning. We look to build on the resilience of foodborne pathogens, their ability to adapt both genetically and phenotypically to changing environments and the particular interest in using these knowledge to understand pathogen responses to food handling practices and ultimately reduce foodborne disease incidence by proposing ways of enhancing food safety, and improve public health.

## Organization 

- `data`: This folder contains the `listeria_isolates.csv` data files used in order to conduct the analyses for our study. This is the cleaned data from the raw data files downloaded directly from the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/). This folder also contains the `analysis_script.R`, which is the code of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- `figures`: This folder contains flow chart of data cleaning in this project. 

- `main_files/figure-latex`: This file contains all figures we get from the full Exploratory Data Analysis report done for the project.

- `main.Rmd`, `main.md` and `main.pdf`: This file contains the written Literature Review and full Exploratory Data Analysis report done for this project. The pdf version hides the code. 

- `references.bib`: This file contains all the reference literatures we list in this project.

More folders and files to be added throughout the course of the project.
